# ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-DATA-ANALYSIS-In-Tableau

# Project Overview
This project presents an in-depth analysis of electric vehicle (EV) data, focusing on various metrics such as the average electric range, total vehicles, and the distribution of vehicles by make, model year, and state. The analysis is performed using Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights into the electric vehicle market.

# Objectives
 1 Data Visualization: Create an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard to present key metrics.
 2 Data Exploration: Provide insights into the distribution and trends of electric vehicles across different states, makes, and models.
 3 Actionable Insights: Enable stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the visualized data.

# Key Features
Total Vehicles: Displays the total number of electric vehicles analyzed.
Average Electric Range: Shows the average electric range of the vehicles.
Total BEV and PHEV Vehicles: Provides the count and percentage of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
Vehicles by Model Year: Visualizes the total number of vehicles by their model year, highlighting trends over time.
Vehicles by State: A map view displaying the distribution of electric vehicles across different states.
Top 10 Vehicles by Make: Lists the top 10 vehicle makes along with their total counts and percentages.
Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility: Pie chart showing the distribution of vehicles by Clean Air Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.
Total Vehicles by Model: Table listing the total number of vehicles by model, type, and their respective percentages.
Data Sources
The data used in this analysis includes various metrics related to electric vehicles, such as vehicle make, model year, type, state of registration, and CAFV eligibility status.

# Technologies Used
Tableau: For creating the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
Python (NumPy, Pandas): For data cleaning and preprocessing.
SQL: For querying and managing the data.
How to Use the Dashboard
Interactive Filters: Use the filters on the left-hand side to explore data at different levels of granularity (e.g., by CAFV eligibility, EV type, model, and state).
Hover and Click: Hover over the visualizations to see detailed data points. Click on specific states, makes, or models to filter the data dynamically.
Insights and Actions: Use the insights gained from the dashboard to make data-driven decisions related to EV market strategies, inventory management, and customer targeting.
Conclusion
The Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the electric vehicle landscape, offering stakeholders valuable insights into market trends, consumer behavior, and operational metrics. By leveraging this dashboard, businesses can enhance their strategic decision-making and drive growth in the electric vehicle sector.
